# Stock-Analysis-Tool
Stock Analysis Tool is an interactive, web-based financial analytics application developed using Python and Streamlit, designed to analyze and visualize stock market data for both Indian and US equities.
The application allows users to enter any stock ticker and explore detailed insights such as price trends, trading volume, moving averages, statistical summaries, and stock-specific news within a user-defined date range.

The tool leverages real-time and historical market data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and applies pandas-driven data analysis techniques to calculate key metrics including maximum price, minimum price, average price, and the exact dates when market highs and lows occurred. These insights help users better understand stock performance and price behavior over time.

To provide a more holistic view of the market, the application also integrates latest stock-related news, enabling users to correlate price movements with real-world events and market sentiment.
Special care has been taken to implement robust error handling and data validation, ensuring the application remains stable even when certain data points such as dividends or corporate actions are unavailable.

With a clean dark-themed UI, interactive charts, and structured summaries, the project closely mirrors real-world stock analysis workflows used in financial and data analytics roles.This project demonstrates practical skills in Python programming, data analysis, financial market analysis, API integration, and the development of interactive analytical dashboards for real-world stock market use cases.
